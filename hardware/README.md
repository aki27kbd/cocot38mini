# Mounting Method

### Integrated
Plate-integrated mount is the simplest mounting method with fewer parts required to assemble. No additional parts are required to build this case. As the plate is thick and integrated with the case structure, it provides a solid feeling relative to other mounting methods.

### Top Mount
Top mount is the general mounting method which is also used for some of custom keyboards. Assembly is relatively difficult due to the need of heated insert nuts. Typing softness can be adjusted depending on the plate material.

### Tadpole Mount
Tadpole mount is designed considering the balance of simple structure and better typing feel. Assembly is relatively easy as long as tadpoles are available. Typing softness can be adjusted depending on the hardness of tadpoles.

# Ball Support Method

### Zirconia Balls
3x Φ2mm zirconia balls support the ball. No additional parts needed. Once zirconia balls are installed, <u>**bearing rollers can not coexist with them**</u>.

### Bearing Rollers
3x bearing rollers support the ball. Ball handling is smoother with less resistance. Bearing roller dimension is ID: 3mm / OD: 6mm / W: 2.5mm.


# Ball Holding Method

### Claw Holder
Claw holder is integrated with the top case and no additional parts needed. Due to the thin structure, it is <u>**not recommended**</u> printing this model with FDM printers.

### Magnet Cover
Magnet cover is an additional part attached to the top case with magnets. 8x Φ3mmxH2mm magnets are needed to assemble this case.




cocot38mini has three mounting method with dedicated case designs. The case compatibility matrix is summarized in the table below:
